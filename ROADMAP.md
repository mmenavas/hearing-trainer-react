# ROADMAP:
- Add a score system.
- Add difficulty levels, where the easiest level just makes you guess contiguous notes. The next level will make you guess notes that are 1 or 2 steps apart. Etc.
- Guess note sequences.
- Prevent pressing buttons while a note is playing or stop the current note before another note is played.
- Back button needs to indicate more clearly that pressing that button exits the current game.
- Disable notes until the wildcard note is heard.
- Make the instrument of choice configurable.
- Provide ability to record melodies.
- Make key of choice configurable.
